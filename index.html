  <h1>EZ-Inventory</h1>
    <p>Inventory management at a restaurant or deli can be a pain! That's why I 
    invented EZ Inventory, an app that integrates a barcode database with your 
    business' inventory spreadsheet. No more pen and paper tours followed by 
    hours of computer work. How many times have you asked in frustration 
    WHY ISN'T THERE AN APP FOR THIS??!? Well, now there is!</p>
